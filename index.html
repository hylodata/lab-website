            This is the personal website of Gabby Resch. I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://businessandit.ontariotechu.ca/" target="_blank">Faculty of Business and IT</a> at Ontario Tech University. I research new methods for making sense of data representations as they move between material and digital contexts.

                        time wrench. At one point, and you need not be an expert tracker to discern this, she stops,
                        pauses, turns to the left to glance at some possible threat or irregularity, and then continues
                        to the north. This motion, so intensely human, transcends time. Three million six hundred
                        thousand years ago, a remote ancestor - just as you or I - experienced a moment of doubt." <br>
